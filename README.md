# MediaUtil - A Java API Package for Media Related Utilities


MediaUtil is an offshoot of the
<a href=http://mediachest.sourceforge.net>MediaChest</a> Project to provide a
well packaged Java API for Media Related Utilities.<p>

Below is the Current API Offering from MediaUtil.<p>

<H2>LLJTran</H2>

LLJTran is an API for performing Lossless Transformations on JPEG image files
which also provides the Capability of handling Exif information.

Following are the key features:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Supports lossless rotation, transpose, transverse and crop
  <li> Trimming or relocating Non Transformable edge blocks similiar to
  <a target=_blank href="http://www.ijg.org">jpegtran</a> or processing them
  like regular MCU blocks.
  <li> Reading and Modifying Image Header Information (Exif) including Thumbnail
  <li> Built-in transformation of Thumbnail and Orientation marker
  <li> Supports the IterativeReader and IterativeWriter interfaces in
       MediaUtil's mediautil.gen.directio package enabling things like Sharing
       the jpeg input file with say jkd's ImageReader while reading
  <li>Does <b>not</b> Support Multi-Threading for the same Object to be
      used simultaneously by more than one thread. However different threads
      can have their own LLJTran Objects.
